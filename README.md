MediaPlayer

Caveat - this could have easily been accomplished with media3. This was just an exercise to build the test app with newer technologies.

MVVM

Clean Architecture
Hilt for DI
Compose Navigation (no fragments)
Jetpack Compose UI
Android MediaPlayer running in seperate service.
PlayerService in separate module

Functionality:
 - Play media
 - Pause Media
 - Skip to next media
 - Skip to previously played media
 - Shuffle modes -> Random, Repeat All, Repeat 1
 - View Library
