MediaPlayer

Caveat - this could have easily been accomplished with media3. This was just an exercise to build the test app with newer technologies.

Technologies
 - MVVM
 - Clean Architecture
 - Hilt for DI
 - Compose Navigation (no fragments)
 - Jetpack Compose UI
 - Android MediaPlayer running in separate service.
 - Foreground notification to persist playback

Functionality:
 - Play media
 - Pause Media
 - Skip to next media base on shuffle mode
 - Skip to previously played media
 - Shuffle modes -> Random, Repeat All, Repeat 1
 - View Library
